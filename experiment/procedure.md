### Procedure

1. **Set Up Simulation Environment**:
   - Open the simulation via `index.html`.
   - Ensure you can input binary data and view the modulated signal.

2. **Input Binary Sequence**:
   - Enter a binary sequence (e.g., 101101).
   - The system will assign two different frequencies to binary 1 and 0.

3. **Observe FSK Modulation**:
   - Observe the waveform corresponding to the binary sequence.
   - Verify that binary 1 corresponds to frequency \( f_1 \) and binary 0 to \( f_2 \).

4. **Demodulation Process**:
   - View the demodulated output.
   - Check if the binary sequence is correctly reconstructed.

5. **Compare Modulated and Demodulated Signals**:
   - Observe timing, frequency variations, and accuracy.

6. **Repeat with Different Inputs**:
   - Try varying sequences to test consistency.
