      "question": "What does FSK stand for in digital communication?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Frequency Shift Keying",
        "b": "Frequency Signal Keying",
        "c": "Fast Signal Keying",
        "d": "Frequency Switching Keying"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanation": "FSK stands for Frequency Shift Keying, a digital modulation technique where data is transmitted through discrete frequency changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "In FSK, how are binary '1' and '0' typically represented?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Different amplitudes",
        "b": "Different frequencies",
        "c": "Different phases",
        "d": "Different time periods"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "FSK represents binary digits using different frequencies - one frequency for '1' (mark) and another for '0' (space)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main advantage of FSK over ASK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Higher data rate",
        "b": "Better noise immunity",
        "c": "Lower bandwidth requirement",
        "d": "Simpler circuit design"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "FSK has better noise immunity than ASK because information is encoded in frequency variations which are less affected by amplitude noise."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which component is essential in an FSK demodulator?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Phase detector",
        "b": "Frequency discriminator",
        "c": "Amplitude limiter",
        "d": "Time delay circuit"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "A frequency discriminator is key in FSK demodulation as it converts frequency variations back to the original digital signal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the term for the frequency difference between mark and space frequencies in FSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Frequency gap",
        "b": "Frequency deviation",
        "c": "Frequency shift",
        "d": "Frequency hop"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "The frequency shift is the difference between the mark (1) and space (0) frequencies in an FSK system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of these is a common application of FSK modulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "FM radio broadcasting",
        "b": "Telephone modems",
        "c": "Digital TV transmission",
        "d": "Fiber optic communication"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "FSK was widely used in telephone modems for data communication over analog telephone lines."
