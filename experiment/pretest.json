      "question": "In FSK, binary 1 and 0 are represented by:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Same frequency",
        "b": "Different amplitudes",
        "c": "Two distinct frequencies",
        "d": "Two different phases"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "In Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), binary 1 and 0 are represented by two different frequencies. This allows the receiver to distinguish between the bits based on frequency changes."

    {
      "question": "FSK modulation is primarily used for:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Audio transmission",
        "b": "Short-range analog communication",
        "c": "Digital data transmission",
        "d": "High-frequency analog signals"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "FSK is commonly used for transmitting digital data over communication channels because it is more robust to noise compared to amplitude-based schemes."

    {
      "question": "What is the main advantage of FSK over ASK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Less bandwidth",
        "b": "Better noise immunity",
        "c": "Simpler hardware",
        "d": "Lower power consumption"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "FSK has better noise immunity than Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) because frequency variations are less affected by noise than amplitude changes."
