    {
      "question": "What is the full form of FSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Frequency Serial Keying",
        "b": "Frequency Shift Keying",
        "c": "Fast Signal Keying",
        "d": "Frequency Standard Keying"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "FSK stands for Frequency Shift Keying, a digital modulation technique where the frequency of the carrier signal is shifted to represent binary data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a prerequisite for digital modulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Analog signal",
        "b": "Digital signal",
        "c": "Noise signal",
        "d": "Radio signal"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Digital modulation requires a digital signal as input, which it encodes into analog waveforms suitable for transmission."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is not a digital modulation technique?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "ASK",
        "b": "FSK",
        "c": "PSK",
        "d": "AM"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanation": "AM (Amplitude Modulation) is an analog modulation technique, unlike ASK, FSK, and PSK which are used in digital modulation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What determines the minimum frequency separation in FSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Baud rate",
        "b": "Carrier amplitude",
        "c": "Noise level",
        "d": "Transmitter power"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanation": "The minimum frequency separation (Î”f) between mark and space frequencies must be at least equal to the baud rate to maintain orthogonality and prevent intersymbol interference."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which demodulation method is most commonly used for FSK in noisy environments?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Envelope detection",
        "b": "Phase-locked loop",
        "c": "Correlation receiver",
        "d": "Slope detection"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "Correlation receivers (matched filters) provide optimal detection for FSK in noisy conditions by comparing received signals with expected mark/space waveforms."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to BER performance when increasing frequency deviation in FSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Improves up to a point then degrades",
        "b": "Always improves",
        "c": "Always worsens",
        "d": "No effect"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanation": "Increasing frequency deviation improves BER by better distinguishing symbols, but excessive deviation wastes bandwidth and may increase susceptibility to other noise types."
