      "question": "What is the full form of FSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Frequency Serial Keying",
        "b": "Frequency Shift Keying",
        "c": "Fast Signal Keying",
        "d": "Frequency Standard Keying"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "FSK stands for Frequency Shift Keying, a digital modulation technique where the frequency of the carrier signal is shifted to represent binary data."
    },

      "question": "Which of the following is a prerequisite for digital modulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Analog signal",
        "b": "Digital signal",
        "c": "Noise signal",
        "d": "Radio signal"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Digital modulation requires a digital signal as input, which it encodes into analog waveforms suitable for transmission."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is not a digital modulation technique?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "ASK",
        "b": "FSK",
        "c": "PSK",
        "d": "AM"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanation": "AM (Amplitude Modulation) is an analog modulation technique, unlike ASK, FSK, and PSK which are used in digital modulation."
