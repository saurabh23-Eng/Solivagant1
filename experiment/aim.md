               #Aim of Experiment.

To study and understand the working principles of Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation and demodulation.

### Objectives:
- To explain the concept of digital modulation using FSK.
- To simulate the modulation and demodulation process for binary data transmission.
- To help learners visualize how frequency varies with input binary data.
- To compare the FSK signal with other digital modulation techniques.
- To equip students with the practical knowledge required to implement FSK in communication systems.
